## What I did today
Today, I started my journey of developing on a Windows OS. My goals are: 
  - learn to code JavaScript
  - figure out development in a Windows environment
  - gain a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures
  
I installed Visual Studio, Node.js, and Git. 

## Thoughts
The switch from MacOS to Windows has been mentally exhausting. The gestures, orientation of windows, and commands are a lot different;
just to do one thing in Windows takes me an inordinate amount of time compared to how long it would take on a Mac.
